# 🧠 NLP Code Explainer — English & Telugu![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.9%2B-blue.svg)


## 📌 Project Overview

**NLP Code Explainer — English & Telugu** is an AI-powered web application designed to help beginners understand programming code by converting it into **simple natural-language explanations**.
The system provides explanations in **English and Telugu**, making programming education more accessible to regional-language learners.

This project combines **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, and an **interactive web interface** to bridge the gap between source code and human understanding.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Many students struggle to learn programming due to:

* Complex technical explanations
* Lack of learning tools in regional languages
* Overly verbose or code-repeating explanations
* Limited accessibility for non-English speakers

Traditional code documentation and tutorials are often **English-only**, which creates a learning barrier for Telugu-medium and regional-language students.

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution

This project solves the above problem by:

* Automatically analyzing programming code
* Generating **clear, beginner-friendly English explanations**
* Translating and explaining the same content in **Telugu**
* Presenting the results through a **simple web-based interface**

The system avoids repeating code and focuses purely on **conceptual understanding**.

## ✨ Example

### Input Code

```python
for i in range(3):
    print(i)
```

### English Explanation

This code runs a loop three times.
The range function generates values from zero to two.
During each iteration, the current value is printed.

### Telugu Explanation

ఈ కోడ్‌లో for లూప్‌ను ఉపయోగించారు.
range(3) ద్వారా 0, 1, 2 విలువలు వస్తాయి.
ప్రతి సారి లూప్ నడిచినప్పుడు ఆ విలువను ప్రింట్ చేస్తుంది.
